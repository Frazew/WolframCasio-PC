## WolframCasio - PC part
This thing is the PC part for WolframCasio. It is written in Java (Sorry!). Even though it may not be the best code you've seen, I wasn't planning to make it public but here it is, crappy but crafted with love !
#What is WolframCasio ?
WolframCasio is a project I started after my maths teacher told me how sad it is not to have Wolfram on that poor FX-9750GII. So when I got home, I took an Arduino, a PC, crafted a nice 3pin-to-wires cable and gathered some time ! And here it is, not finished yet and not perfect at all.
#Where can I find the other sources ?
All the sources you should need to run it are available in those repositories :
* http://github.com/Frazew/WolframCasio-PC/ <-- This is where you are
* http://github.com/Frazew/WolframCasio <-- This is where you will find the arduino and calculator code alongside with the details.

#And the licence ?
As always, GNU GPL ! Please be sure you respect it !
